# UCTPfittingtools

This repository contains the code of an application written in Python during an internship at the University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague (UCTP). The application allows one to extract physical parameters from impedance spectra and polarisation curves from large datasets. Its added value is that it can be used to automatically fit large datasets of impedance spectra contained in a folder and provide fast and accurate results (typically with less than 1s computation time per spectrum).

# Data
Data provided in this repo were acquired on PEMFCs by my supervisor and were an useful basis for the development of the application. There are three types of datasets: impedance spectra, polarisation curves and cyclic voltammetries.
