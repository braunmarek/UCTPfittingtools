# UCTPfittingtools

This repository contains the code of an application written in Python during an internship at the University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague (UCTP). The application allows one to extract physical parameters from impedance spectra and polarisation curves from large datasets. Its added value is that it can be used to automatically fit large datasets of impedance spectra contained in a folder and provide fast and accurate results (typically with less than 1s computation time per spectrum). The application allows one to choose between four impedance models, three optimisation algorithms. It also includes search for intial parameter values to reduce the computation time.

Please note that I am currently working on a project in the continuity of this internship to add more features to the application such as customisation of impedance models, display of Bode plot, analysis using DRT and Kramers-Kronig transformation.

# Data
The data provided in this repo were collected on PEMFCs by my supervisor and provided an useful basis for the development of the application. There are three types of datasets: impedance spectra, polarisation curves and cyclic voltammetries.
